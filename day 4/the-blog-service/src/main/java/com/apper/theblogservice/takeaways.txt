Key Takeaways:
1. Springboot is used in creating REST API and micro services.
2. In a REST API, it is important to have the entities, payload, repository, service, and controller.
3. The entities in Springboot are like the mapped table in the database.
4. The payload is the data being transferred in the API
5. It is important to have a repository class so there will be no direct access to the database.
6. The service and controller contains the logic of the whole API. 
7. There are different HTTP headers like Post (for creating), Get (for obtaining), Put (for updating), Delete (for deleting), and etc.
